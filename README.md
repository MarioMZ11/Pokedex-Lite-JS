# Pokedex Lite

This is a little demo of the famuos Pokedex build with HTML - CSS - JS using webpack.

Just press the Pokemon Button for request a random Pokemon.
I use fetch API for make the http requets to the Pokemon API.

Enjoy!

## Notes - Reminder:

Rebuild the node modules with:
```
npm install
```
For build the webpack files for run the application:
```
npm run build
```
